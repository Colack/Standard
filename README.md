This is our [Standard](https://github.com/code-org-open-source/Standard) libary. It comes with all sorts of tools for programming applications, and allows for easier use of the many different tools that [Code.org](https://code.org) provides.   

Due to the way that [Code.org](https://code.org) handles libraries for Applab, this is not one big library, it is actually dozens, they are all catagorized under one big library for organization purposes.

## Catagories
There are many different libraries with many different purposes:

- **console**   
Libraries focused on working with the console.  
- **values**  
Libraries focused on tweaking, writing and reading different values inside of the application.   
- **display**    
Libraries focusing on displaying stuff on the screen.    
- **utility**   
Libraries focused on random useful features.   
- **other**    
Other Libraries for things like credits and such.
