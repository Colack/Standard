## CDOStandard (InDev)
This is the Standard library for code.org. It comes with all sorts of tools and applications for programming, 
and allows for easier use of the tools that code.org provides.

Due to the way the Code.org handles libraries, this library is actually split into many different libraries,
each with catagories for different uses.

The libraries are split by the different modes that code.org has. This includes, (But is not limited to)
Applab and Gamelab.

You can find the catagories inside of the './src' folder.


## Releases
There are currently no releases for the standard library at the moment, but some of our tools do have releases.
Check the 'releases' tab for more information.
